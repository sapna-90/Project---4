This project focuses on extracting relevant features from a dataset of mobile phones and using these features to predict the price of the phones.
It involves various steps, including data preprocessing, handling missing values, outlier removal, and applying machine learning models for price prediction.  
Outliers are handled using different methods such as IQR, Z-Score, Isolation Forest, etc. In this project, we used IQR method to identify the extreme values.
After preprocessing the data, we split it into training and testing sets, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
We use different documentations to fit the model like pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikit learn, matplotlib etc.
